## Complex Numbers DDTool
### Description
Complex Numbers DDTool is a python program used for helping students to better understand operations with complex numbers
and test their knowledge in this subject. Also, the modules can be reused for other applications working with complex numbers.
### Getting started
The following instructions and information will help you to install and start/develop the app:
#### Prerequisites
In order to work on this project you will need the following things:

1. Python IDE (Python IDE, Pydev with Eclipse, PyCharm etc)
2. Git

I can't provide tutorials for how to install these softwares, but I am sure that you will manage to do it on your own.:)
#### Instructions
The following instructions will help you to use the app or modify it if you want:
* Copy the repository using the command (in Git Bash):
```
    git copy https://github.com/Skysoulther/Python-assignments-A1.git
```
* Open the folder _Complex Numbers DDTool_ where you can find the python modules of the app:
* Now you have to options:
    * If you want to run the app you double-click the file called **App.py** and then follow the user instructions
    * If you want to develop the app, then you can open any module you want using the IDE and start the development work.
    (It would be a good idea to look through all modules so that you understand how the app works at that moment)
* Now you can use the app however you want (after all it is just a homework assignment)

**NOTE:** For more instuctions about using the app I suggest reading the files: **Documentation.doc** and **help commands.txt**

Maybe I should add more sections about running tests and how the app was built, but I think that they are not so important here. This is just a homework assignment and I consider that these parts are not needed in this case.
In addition, this is only a practice. :)
