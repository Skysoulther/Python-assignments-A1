In this file you may find useful information about using the command-based UI of Complex Numbers DDTool.

There are several commands that can be used with the command-based UI:

1. add complex_number

    - It adds the complex_number to the list

2. insert complex_number at position

    - It inserts the complex_number at a certain position of the list

3. remove position

    - Removes the element at a position

4. remove position1 to position2

    - Removes the elementsbetween two positions

5. replace complex_number1 with complex_number1

    - Replace all the occurrences of the complex_number1 with the complex_number2

6. list

    - Show the list of elements

7. list real position1 to position2

    - Show all the real elements from the list between position1 and position2

8. list modulo </=/> number

    - Show all the elements which have a modulus smaller/equal/bigger than number

9. sum position1 to position2

    - Show the sum of the elements between positiona and position2

10. product position1 to position2

    - Show the product of the elements between positiona and position2

11. filter real

    - Keep only real numbers in the list

12. filter modulo </=/> number

    - Keep in the list only the elements having modulus smaller/equal/bigger than number

13. undo

    - undo the last operation that modified program data

14. exit

    - close the program

Examples:

    add -1+4i
    insert -1-1i at 1
    remove 1
    remove 1 to 3
    replace 1+3i with 5-3i
    list
    list real 1 to 5
    list modulo < 10
    sum 1 to 5
    product 1 to 5
    filter real
    filter modulo > 6
    undo
    exit

NOTE: The format of complex_number can be 'a+bi','a-bi', '-a+bi' or '-a-bi', where a and b are natural numbers. (For a better understanding, look at the examples!)
